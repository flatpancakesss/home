For years now, I've joked about how Rosmontis is "the worst Sniper in Arknights". While this is an exaggeration, recently I've been thinking about Rosmontis, her viability, and how she could be improved. I've come to the conclusion that she might *actually* be the one of the worst 6 star Snipers in the game, which is a shame as she's a personal favourite of mine and I love her role in the story.

## What makes Rosmontis bad?

Rosmontis isn't a "bad" Operator, she's just very underwhelming addition in a class where most operators are capable of instantly nuking boss enemies.

Rosmontis' goal isn't about nuking enemies, rather she's more focused on using large AOE attacks to clean up groups of weak enemies.

Her biggest weakness comes from her complete inability to hit any aerial targets, a trait she inherits from being apart of the 'Flinger' subclass.

The Flinger subclass consists of Rosmontis, Wiš'adel, Greyy the Lightningbearer, and the Terra Research Commission.

For this sake of this analysis, I'm only going to be talking about Rosmontis and Wiš'adel. Greyy is a 5 star and therefore not relevant to what I'm talking about here, and the Terra Research Commission is a 1 star joke operator that you should never use anyways.

Archetyes are usually based around their limitation. Juggernaunts cannot be healed, but have incredible self sustain and healing. Flagbearers are cannot block enemies, but provide incredible DP generation, etc.

But the Flinger subclass is nothing but a limitation that holds Rosmontis back.

If Wiš'adel is allowed to completely ignore the limitation of the subclass, why can't Rosmontis do the same?

Rosmontis is a 6 star limited operator, making her extremely hard to obtain. Outside of only 1 or 2 banners per year, Rosmontis is 

For a limited operator, Rosmontis' capabilities are very lacklustre

Other similar operators can target drones but she cant

Skill 3 is extremely unreliable.

## Would allowing Rosmontis to hit drones be too powerful?

No.

If Rosmontis was able to hit aerial enemies, it wouldn't make her.  

It could even give her some much needed utility.

The first thought that comes to mind is IS3. Highmore is much harder to kill when she's in the air, but you can use a stun to bring her to the ground. Rosmontis' 2nd skill has a high chance to stun the target, which would make her a good fit

Her 3rd skill wouldn't even work as it can only attack blocked enemies. Technically you can block aerial enemies using [], but this is honestly too niche to be a practical solution.

In a way, you could see it as trading raw DPS output in exchange for more general viability.

I can only see giving her

At first I thought this wouldn't be possible, but then I realised Archetto has 3 modules anyway.

## Similar Operators

Looking at other 6 star Snipers...

Fartooth has a kit that's similarly underwhelming, but what makes her better than Rosmontis in my opinion is that she's not an ultra rare limited operator only available for 2 weeks a year.
