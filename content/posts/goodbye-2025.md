2025 has been very busy, a lot has happened this year! It's crazy to think that we are already entering the 2nd half of the 2020s. 2020->2025 somehow both feels like it's lasted forever and also no time at all. ^ ^;

I'd like to take a moment of self reflection to look back on this year and the things I'm proud of. It'd be impossible for me to write about *everything* that happened this year, so instead I'd like to focus on some personal highlights as well as sharing my plans going forwards into 2026.

## Art

The most substantial part of my year, and what I'm personally most proud of is my progress in learning to draw. I've [already talked about this at length before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ZfxAKD2mU), but in short I've always wanted to draw ever since I was very young, I just never persued it until recently.

In August of 2024, I started taking drawing seriously and began to learn. This continued onwards into 2025 where I drew every single day for the entire year. I've compiled one drawing from each month to show how much I've grown this year. Take a look!

I'm still very much a beginner, but I'm happy in my progress and confident that I will continue to improve!

## Development projects

In October, I participated in Touhou Fan Game Jam 16 and [provided some art assets for my friends to use](https://blog.flatpancakesss.dev/posts/my-contributions-for-touhou-fan-game-jam-16/). This was my first time providing art assets for any sort of collaborative project and was a huge step outside of my comfort zone. I'm only a drawing newcomer, so I was worried I wouldn't be "good enough" to provide art for my friends to use but I'm really proud of the result!

I also created this website this year! Even though its still a work in progress in some areas, I'm still very happy with it. I'm by no means a professional writer, nor do I have any plans to become one, but this website offers me a place to write about whatever I want and share those with whoever may be interested. Yeah social media offers the same thing too, but I don't like social media lol especially what has become of it in recent years.

I'm very happy to each one of my friends who reads these posts or even if there's any readers out there who I don't know on a personal level. Your continued interest and support means a lot to me :)

## Miscellaneous stuff that I don't know how else to catagorise

In 2025, I finally finished formal education, graduating from university in August. I've always hated school, so I'm super happy to have gotten that over with.

As for travel, I went to both Orlando, Florida and Torrence, California to visit both my family members and attend TouhouFest 2025! I had a lovely time in both places and I'll also be writing a seperate post about that trip to California, as I have a lot I want to talk about there.

## Goals for 2026

Around 2023, I was having ideas for a Touhou fangame that I wanted to develop. The original idea was something simple, a short game about Daiyousei searching for Cirno, her best friend who had gone missing.

As I planned out this further over 2024, I began adding more and more concepts that didn't really have anything to do with Touhou. Eventually it became clear that I didn't even want to make a Touhou game anymore, and wanted to make something original instead.

From there, I began working on an original RPG game rather than a fangame. OC characters, OC story, everything. I don't have much to show just yet, but just know that I've been working quietly on this project in the background.

Going into 2026, I want to put a larger focus on working on this game. I'll need more time until I'm actually ready to showcase anything publicly, but I'm really excited to share my details about my project when I'm able to. The project has evolved quite far from it's original roots as a simple Touhou fangame and I'm hopeful that people may like my ideas

Just so its out there, there's almost certainly a 100% chance that this game won't be releasing in 2026, or even 2027 for that matter though lol. This is much more of a "hey I'm working on something :)" rather than a formal official announcment with a trailer and release deadline.

That's all for today, or I guess that's all for this year as a whole ^ ^;

Thanks for reading, see you next year. ♡
