A shop managment game in which you make silly hats to appease orders of faries who enter the store. I handled both character design and creation of the fairy sprites.

[Touhou Fan Game Jam 16](https://itch.io/jam/touhou-jam-16) submission, co-developed with [Jwap](https://x.com/jwapptastic) and [Redi](https://x.com/redi_rkgk). Ougi was unable to participate this time around, so I provided art assets to fill his place.
