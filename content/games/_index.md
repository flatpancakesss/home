Here is a collection of my smaller game development projects, consisting almost entirely of game jam submissions and short Touhou fangames that I developed on my spare time during my school years. 

I have a larger, original game currently in development, but it will take a lot of time. For now, enjoy these smaller titles. Each game runs in your browser with no downloads necessary.
