A simple bullet hell game that I made in 2 days for a school exam when I was about 15 to 16 years old. I had no ability to draw at this time, so I used simple geometric shapes and a mostly monochrome color scheme to create the visuals for the game.

#### Developed sometime in March 2022. No public release planned.
