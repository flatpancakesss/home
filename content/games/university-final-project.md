##### Gameplay demo has been recorded without audio due to usage of placeholder music tracks, sorry!

A short bullet hell adventure game, developed solo and on a tight deadline as a final submission for my university course. Uses Reisen's Combat Training as a basis and expands massively upon it with new enemy types, new player abilities and an Adventure Mode alongside the original endless survival mode. 

#### Developed 6 August 2025. No public release planned.
